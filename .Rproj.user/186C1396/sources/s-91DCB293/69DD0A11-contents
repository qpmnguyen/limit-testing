Welcome to the *Limit Testing* Blog. Contrary to the initial design, I've decided to separate my blogging platform from my personal website. The goal is to have a more robust (and nicer looking) space for more data-intensive posts, which will be part of my data analysis portfolio.  

I'll also add posts from other subjects too!  

If you're interested, check me out at my [personal webpage](https://qpmnguyen.netlify.app/), [GitHub](https://github.com/qpmnguyen), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/quangpmnguyen) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qpmnguyen/).
